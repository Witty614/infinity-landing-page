Rather, Be Infinity exclusively offers training and education services and the Affiliate must restrict its advertising and sales activities to the area of education. The Affiliate is therefore obligated to comply with the aforementioned requirements in a mandatory and stringent manner and to inform potentially interested parties about this circumstance during the Affiliate activity.  \n c) The Affiliate is expressly prohibited from brokering financial investment services (such as forex trading, stock trading, asset management, DeFi services or crypto trading) or other securities or financial investments or comparable services to potential customers or otherwise advertising such services to itself or third parties within the scope of or in connection with its activities for Be Infinity. Furthermore, the Affiliate is expressly prohibited from granting a loan or benefit to potential customers themselves in order to enable them to finance Be Infinity's education services or their ancillary costs in whole or in part. \n d) Sales and marketing actions must not simulate commissions, which are to be understood as 'bounty' or other commission in connection with the mere recruitment of a new Affiliate. No actions shall be taken that create the appearance that the advertised distribution system is an illegal distribution system, namely an illegal progressive pyramid scheme or pyramid scheme or otherwise a fraudulent distribution system. Likewise, it must not be pretended that Be Infinity distributes a financial investment, asset investment, currency investment, or FinTech services, or sells or otherwise distributes Defi, cryptocoins or other cryptocurrencies or similar services itself or through third parties.  \n e) Affiliate advertising or sales negotiations shall not be directed at minors or persons inexperienced in business and shall under no circumstances take advantage of their age, illness or limited ability to understand in order to induce consumers to conclude a contract. In the case of contacts with so-called socially weak or foreign-language groups of the population, the Affiliate shall show due consideration for their financial capacity and their ability to understand and comprehend the language. Everything is to be refrained from which could induce the members of such groups to place orders that are not appropriate to their circumstances. \n f) No affiliate actions may be taken that are inappropriate, illegal, unsafe, or put undue pressure on the selected consumers. \n g) Affiliate will use only officially authorized by Be Infinity documents when contacting potential. \n h) Potential customers will not be induced to accept services by dubious and/or misleading promises when establishing contact, nor by promises of special benefits if these benefits are linked to future, uncertain successes. The Affiliate will refrain from doing anything that could induce potential customers to accept Be Infinity services merely in order to do the Affiliate a personal favor, to end an unwanted conversation or to enjoy a benefit that is not the subject of the offer or to show gratitude for the granting of such a benefit.",

In particular, this website uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as your contact requests that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from 'http://' to 'https://' and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties. Nevertheless, we would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is therefore not possible.",
